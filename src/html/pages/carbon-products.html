				<p>Electric arc furnaces can be part of integrated steel mills, but are also common as separate plants. Steel is produced in batches, with the main intention being to melt down scrap and adjust composition to suit the steel product requirements. Carbon is added to EAF steel as:
					· Charge carbon – added to scavenge oxygen and avoid re-oxidising of the metallics and alloys.
					· Slag foaming – added to react with oxygen in the slag to form carbon monoxide gas, which foams the molten slag and improves the energy efficiency of the process.
					· Recarburizer – added to raise the carbon content of steel just prior to casting.
					Carbon product basis from
					EAF steel is more widely produced than primary steel in integrated mills where high capital, land and infrastructure requirements can be inhibitive for smaller production without access to domestic raw materials (e.g. South East Asia). The developing industries in China and India are key variations to the global BF/BOF to EAF steel balance.</p>
